# â†‘ Pay attention to the user who made the tarfile you want to extract.
# If you had to "sudo" to make it, then it is owned by "root", and you need to "sudo" to extract it - otherwise "tar" will inadvertently make your current user the owner of all of the files, ruining the permissions in the process!
